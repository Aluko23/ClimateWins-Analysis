Introduction

Climate change has become one of the most pressing global issues in recent years. As global temperatures rise due to human activity, weather patterns are shifting, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe. To understand and mitigate the effects of climate change, it is essential to analyze current weather conditions, trends, and forecast models. ClimateWins, a platform designed for climate data analysis, provides an opportunity to observe and predict weather patterns across various global regions, offering insight into the challenges posed by climate change.

How is machine learning used?

Machine learning (ML) identifies patterns within complex weather data to make predictions. Three ML algorithms used are:

•	K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): Groups data points by proximity, useful for classifying similar weather conditions.
•	Decision Tree: Uses a tree structure for decision-making, effective for data with multiple criteria.
•	Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Mimics the brain’s neural structure, excellent for detecting complex weather patterns.

These methods help in forecasting and climate modeling by recognizing and predicting weather trends.


Executive Summary: Weather Prediction Model Performance

This analysis reviews the algorithm’s accuracy in predicting weather data across multiple stations. The model performs well overall with an average accuracy of 88% but shows station-specific variations. Key insights include:

1. High Accuracy in Stable Climates: Stations like Sonnblick (100%) and Kassel and Oslo (90%) demonstrate high accuracy, likely due to stable weather patterns.

2. Challenges with Complex Climates: Stations like Madrid and Belgrade, with higher false positive rates, suggest complex or variable weather patterns that the model struggles to predict accurately.

3. Potential Overfitting: Sonnblick’s perfect accuracy suggests the model may be overly tailored to this station, potentially reducing generalizability.

Recommendations: Enhanced data preprocessing for complex regions, overfitting monitoring, and targeted model tuning could improve accuracy and adaptability across diverse weather conditions.
